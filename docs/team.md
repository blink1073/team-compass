# Current team members

This page lists (alphabetically) the officially named Jupyter Server Team.

## Active members

```{eval-rst}

.. include:: team/active.txt

```

## Inactive members

Inactive team members are (temporarily or not) pausing their active participation in the Jupyter Server community. They can reactivate themselves at any point in the future; it does not require a nomination by a current active member.

```

## Software Steering Council (SSC) Representative

Each *official* subproject in Jupyter gets a single [Software Steering Council representative](https://jupyter.org/governance/software_steering_council.html#software-steering-council). Jupyter Server's representative is elected by the active team members. In the Jupyter Server subproject, our representative is elected to a one-year term.
